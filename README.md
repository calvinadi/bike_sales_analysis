# bike_sales_analysis

From the analysis I did, I get some insights which is: 

There's no married female customer who bought a bike from Europe and North America. There could be a few reasons for this, for example the data not representative of the entire population. It's also possible that married female customers in Europe and North America are more likely to purchase bikes from other channels, such as online retailers or specialty bike shops, that are not represented in this data set.

Male customers tend to spend more on bikes than female customers. This could be due to a number of factors, such as the fact that men are more likely to cycle for sport or recreation

The highest count of customers is middle ages customers in North America, than  customers in Europe or the Pacific. This could be due to a number of factors, such as the higher cost of living in Europe, or the greater popularity of cycling in Europe.

Customers with higher levels of education tend to spend more on bikes. This could be due to a number of factors, such as the fact that they have higher incomes, or that they are more likely to value the health benefits of cycling.

Customers who commute by bike prefer to use it for short distance transportation. Most likely they prefer to use car or other transportation for distance more than 10 miles.
